    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may know, we are in the process of moving the project and all the related web resources over to GitHub. As a first step, I have set up the <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp">Tracks project</a> as a GitHub Organisation, which makes it easier for people to administer and collaborate on the project. I have also moved the content of the entire wiki over to a GitHub wiki, <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki">here</a>. I&#8217;ve removed the old wiki to avoid confusion, and redirected the <span class="caps">URL</span> to the new wiki.</p>
<p>You can still contribute to the new wiki: if you have a GitHub account, you can edit and add pages. I hope you like the new wiki &#8211; I think it is a big improvement, and a lot more flexible.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.0">Git <span class="caps">URL</span></a></p>
<p>A message from Reinier Balt, who has worked incredibly hard on this release. Congratulations to him and to all the other contributors!</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After way too long time (1.7 was released on 28 feb 2009!) we are finally releasing Tracks 2.0. I&#8217;m hoping to shorten the release cycle in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>You can download this new stable version of Tracks <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Important for upgrade is that the requirements for running Tracks have changed (ruby 1.8.7 / rubgems ~1.5.0). Also be aware when upgrading from a recent development version or RC version to delete the caches stylesheets and javascripts from your install. The updated installation manual can be found on github and on the Tracks website, also containing the details of the changed requirements and deleting the cached files from your previous install.</p>
<p>Please note that xuinkrbin has started a <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Users-Manual">user manual</a> on the wiki. Anyone like to help out and write some stuff about setting up and using Tracks? A user manual if often asked for.</p>
<p>A lot of effort went into Tracks 2.0 and we have seen quite a few new (and old :-) ) contributors helping out with patches and github pull requests. Thanks to you all!</p>
<p>Now, onto the details of this release.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<p>1. Redesign of menus and introduction of a context menu per todo<br />
2. You can now set the default tags for a project which are added automatically to a new action in that project if no tags are supplied<br />
3. Tracks now includes support of dependencies. Making an action dependent on another action will hide it until the dependency is completed<br />
4. you can now drag an action from one context to another<br />
5. Support for entering multiple actions in one form<br />
6. You can now promote an action to a project<br />
7. It is easier to view notes on the mobile interface and other interface fixes<br />
8. The project description supports markup<br />
9. support for Mail.app (message://) and OneNote (onenote://) links in notes<br />
10.The email receiver is now able to receive email from several email adresses.  In site.yml this could be set to the previous behavior (receive from one address per user)<br />
11.You can enable open signup (like in tracks.tra.in) <br />
12.Cleanup of context page<br />
13.Support for <span class="caps">CAS</span> for login<br />
14.Support for adding Tracks as a GMail Widget with instructions on the Integrations page<br />
15.Tracks now support internationalization. First translations are German and Dutch. See http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Translating-Tracks it you like to help translating Tracks to other languages. Please report any errors in translations to our bug tracker at Assembla!</p>
<p>Under the hood</p>
<p>1. All js is migrated to jQuery and most ui-widgets are migrated to jQuery-UI<br />
2. Cucumber is added for integration testing. The RSpec stories are migrated to cucumber, so are most selenium scripts<br />
3. Upgraded to rails 2.3.11 and upgraded most gems/plugins<br />
3. Bugfixes (lots of them)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The nice people at <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/">JumpBox</a> have just released a <a href="http://jumpbox.com/app/tracks">JumpBox for Tracks 1.7</a>. JumpBoxes are pre-built, pre-configured virtual applications which run in a range of <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/supported-virtualization-software">Virtualization software applications</a>. You just download the JumpBox (free), then open the file with your Virtualization software. Once the JumpBox has booted, it will give you a <span class="caps">URL</span> which you can visit in a browser. The software will then guide you through setting up an account. If you&#8217;d like to try out the JumpBox without installing it, you can use the &#8220;Trial This JumpBox&#8221; button on the web site, which will let you play around with it to test it out. It&#8217;s great to have another method of using Tracks for those of you who don&#8217;t want to go to the trouble of installing Tracks and its dependencies on your computer, or installing Tracks on a web host. Try it out! You can download it directly <a href="http://download.jumpbox.com/download/tracks">here</a>. I&#8217;ll add links and instructions to the manual in due course.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/tree/1.7_branch">Git <span class="caps">URL</span></a></p>
<p>Reinier Balt has already announced the release of Tracks 1.7RC2, but I&#8217;ve finally (and belatedly!) found time to upload the zipped file and update the manual.</p>
<p>Reinier&#8217;s release notes:</p>
<p>We have many improvements based on the feedback on RC1. We felt we should first do a RC2 to make sure all improvements did not introduce new regressions. Please help out to test this second pre-release to find any bugs before we release 1.7 in a few weeks</p>
<p>What was new in RC1:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The included Rails version is updated to 2.2.2</li>
	<li>Tracks now supports recurring/repeating todos</li>
	<li>Cleanup of feed page and add feed for starred actions</li>
	<li>Initial importer of yaml files (still very <span class="caps">EXPERIMENTAL</span>; please send feedback on whether to include this; make backups while testing it)</li>
	<li>New interface to import an email / sms messages into Tracks (needs an email server on the same server as Tracks)</li>
	<li>New buttons to quickly defer an action 1 or 7 days</li>
	<li>Calendar view to review upcoming due actions, includes iCal feed to use in your calendar app (tested with Google Calendar, Evolution, Outlook 2007)</li>
	<li>You can now sort projects on number of active todos</li>
	<li>Support for OpenSearch. This means you can add a Tracks as a search provider in your webbrowser (tested on FF3 and IE7)</li>
	<li>Bugfixes, including fixing OpenID</li>
</ul>
<p>New in RC2:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We now allow users again to stay logged in on two devices at the same time</li>
	<li>Move site specific configuration out of environment.rb into site.yml for easier updating</li>
	<li>Bugfixes, including the upgrade of has_many_polymorphs which will fix the problem of not being able to migrate from 1.6 because of non-existing recurring_todos table.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are changes to the database (even between RC1 and RC2), and changes to the way you configure Tracks, so please migrate your database and redo your Tracks configuration.</p>
<p>In Tracks 1.7RC2 the site specific configuration is moved from environment.rb into the new site.yml. This makes updating environment.rb much easier without you needing to set your site specific settings after each update. After you install/upgrade Tracks 1.7RC2 there will be no environment.rb.tmpl anymore. You will find an environment.rb which you can leave untouched. Just fill in your settings from your old environment.rb in the new site.yml. If you have made any other customizations to environment.rb in the past, you can put them in your own configuration file (for example, in my-config.rb) in config/initializers. Please let us know it you think they should be in site.yml.tmpl.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">WARNING</span>: if you update to RC2 using git, your environment.rb will be overwritten. SO <span class="caps">PLEASE</span> <span class="caps">MAKE</span> <span class="caps">BACKUPS</span></strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re cloning or forking Tracks from <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks/">GitHub</a>, you might be interested in some changes you can make to your .bashrc to make using git a bit more comfortable. Henrik over at The Pug Automatic posted <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt">this tip</a> for putting both your current branch name on the command line, and also indicating whether you have any uncommitted changes in the branch. If your branch has uncommitted changes, it prints an asterisk after the branch name. This is incredibly helpful for seeing at a glance what state you are in, without having to issue the commands &#8216;git branch&#8217; or &#8216;git status&#8217;. If you flit about between branches a lot, having the branch name at the command prompt can save you from a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>You can grab Henrik&#8217;s code <a href="http://gist.github.com/31631">here</a>, or use mine below. I just foraged around among the forks and the comments on <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/13/show-your-git-branch-name-in-your-prompt/">this related post</a> to get a version combining the best bits of them all, then I substituted in my existing command prompt. Enjoy!</p>

I have now completed the migration to the new Shared Accelerator at <a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent.com</a>, and in the process, gave Tracks its own domain name: getontracks.org. You may find that the new server feels a bit more snappy than the old one, and it should be more stable and reliable. The migration process was fairly complex, and it&#8217;s possible that some links may be broken, so do please email me if you find anything amiss. I&#8217;ve redirected the old domain to the new one, so feed readers should pick up the redirection.

<p>I was hoping to replace our Trac bug tracker with a custom solution run with ExpressionEngine (which runs this site), but importing existing tickets proved too much for my pre-Christmas brain! Instead, I imported all the old tickets into an <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/tracks-tickets/tickets">Assembla space</a>. Assembla offers a number of rather cool features, and will be easier for me to administer. You can find out how to use the site to submit tickets <a href="http://getontracks.org/development/">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m off to Brazil for a work course again on Monday, and I&#8217;ll be away for 3 weeks. I won&#8217;t have email or web access during that time, so can I ask that you direct any questions to the forum or mailing list where other Tracks users will be able to help you. If you want to make a pull request on GitHub, or if you&#8217;ve got a patch, <a href="https://github.com/lukemelia">lukemelia</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lrbalt">lrbalt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/epall">epall</a> all have commit rights to the main repository, so you can send your request to them.</p>
<p>Have a great summer everyone, and I&#8217;ll post again when I get back!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GitHub provides a handy shortcut for creating a <a href="http://pledgie.org/">Pledgie</a> campaign, and shows the button on the repository page. We were previously accepting donations using a Paypal button, which meant I then had to do some mental arithmetic and manually update the MacBook-O-Meter to show the additional donations. Pledgie is much easier to use, so I&#8217;ve now embedded the Pledgie button on the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/tracks/contribute">Contribute</a> page, and also in the sidebar of the site. Click the button if you feel like making a donation! Pledgie donations can be anonymous or you can display your name proudly in the donors list, and you can use PayPal or a credit card for payment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spanish-speaking Tracks users will be interested to know that <a href="http://www.bitnami.org/">BitNami</a> have a couple of <a href="http://www.bitnami.org/article/tracks-aprende-a-manejar-tus-tareas">screencasts</a> in Spanish, showing the installation process with BitNami (which was produced by <a href="http://www.screencasts.es/">Javier Mart&#237;nez</a>) and an introduction to using Tracks. Many thanks to Antonio Santos at BitNami for pointing me to the screencasts, and for telling me that Tracks was the third most downloaded Stack on BitNami last month!</p>

    <link href="http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/tracks-moves-to-github/"/>
    <updated>2008-06-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/tracks-moves-to-github</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m happy to say that Tracks has now moved to GitHub. The subversion repository is still available as a read-only repository, but all new development will happen via <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> at  <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks/tree">GitHub</a>. The main reason for this move is to make it much easier for people to contribute to the project. Anyone can clone the repository and submit patches, but to make life even easier, you can sign up for a free account at GitHub and then fork Tracks. GitHub provides a &#8216;pull request&#8217; button, so when you&#8217;ve added something cool or fixed a bug, hit the button and we&#8217;ll pull in your changes. Git makes merging <strong>much</strong> easier than Subversion, even if the codebase has moved on a bit since you created the patch.</p>
<p>The latest stable version of Tracks can still be downloaded as a .zip file (see the download link in the sidebar). If you don&#8217;t want to install Git, but you are feeling adventurous and want to get the very latest development version, you can use the &#8216;Download&#8217; button on the GitHub page to get a tarball of the project.</p>
<p>To clone Tracks, change to a directory in which you want to store Tracks (e.g. ~/Sites):</p>
<pre>
<code>
git clone git://github.com/bsag/tracks.git
cd tracks
</code>
</pre>
<p>If (when!) you produce a cool new feature or fix a bug, create a patch. If you develop in a branch called &#8216;experiment&#8217;:</p>
<pre>
<code>
git diff master..experiment &gt; my_feature.patch 
</code>
</pre>
<p>Then attach my_feature.patch to a ticket.</p>
<p>Or you can sign up for a free account on github and fork Tracks using the convenient button. You can then use the button to issue a pull request for your changes to be pulled into the main repository.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Tracks 1.6]]></title>
    <link href="http://TracksApp.github.com/downloads/comments/tracks-16/"/>
    <updated>2008-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/downloads/comments/tracks-16</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Version: Tracks 1.6</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Tracks 1.6 has been released.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The included Rails version is updated to 2.0.2</li>
	<li>You can now search the contents of todos, projects and notes (thanks, Jeffrey Gipson!)</li>
	<li>Improvements to the mobile view, including a few iPhone specific improvements for those of you lucky enough to have an iPhone</li>
	<li>A few bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>An important caveat is that OpenID support is broken in 1.6. The fix is a bit complicated because of changes to the ruby-openid gem, so we wanted to get 1.6 out before fixing it. If you depend on OpenID support, we&#8217;d advise waiting until the next release.</p>
<p>There are no changes to the database, but quite a few changes to config/environment.rb.tmpl, so please copy the template file and merge your personalisations with it.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Luke, Reinier and Jeffrey for their hard work on this release!</p>]]></content>
