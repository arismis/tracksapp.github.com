    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/the-wiki-has-moved</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may know, we are in the process of moving the project and all the related web resources over to GitHub. As a first step, I have set up the <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp">Tracks project</a> as a GitHub Organisation, which makes it easier for people to administer and collaborate on the project. I have also moved the content of the entire wiki over to a GitHub wiki, <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki">here</a>. I&#8217;ve removed the old wiki to avoid confusion, and redirected the <span class="caps">URL</span> to the new wiki.</p>
<p>You can still contribute to the new wiki: if you have a GitHub account, you can edit and add pages. I hope you like the new wiki &#8211; I think it is a big improvement, and a lot more flexible.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The nice people at <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/">JumpBox</a> have just released a <a href="http://jumpbox.com/app/tracks">JumpBox for Tracks 1.7</a>. JumpBoxes are pre-built, pre-configured virtual applications which run in a range of <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/supported-virtualization-software">Virtualization software applications</a>. You just download the JumpBox (free), then open the file with your Virtualization software. Once the JumpBox has booted, it will give you a <span class="caps">URL</span> which you can visit in a browser. The software will then guide you through setting up an account. If you&#8217;d like to try out the JumpBox without installing it, you can use the &#8220;Trial This JumpBox&#8221; button on the web site, which will let you play around with it to test it out. It&#8217;s great to have another method of using Tracks for those of you who don&#8217;t want to go to the trouble of installing Tracks and its dependencies on your computer, or installing Tracks on a web host. Try it out! You can download it directly <a href="http://download.jumpbox.com/download/tracks">here</a>. I&#8217;ll add links and instructions to the manual in due course.</p>

    <updated>2009-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/articles/comments/making-yourself-comfortable-with-git-in-the-terminal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re cloning or forking Tracks from <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks/">GitHub</a>, you might be interested in some changes you can make to your .bashrc to make using git a bit more comfortable. Henrik over at The Pug Automatic posted <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt">this tip</a> for putting both your current branch name on the command line, and also indicating whether you have any uncommitted changes in the branch. If your branch has uncommitted changes, it prints an asterisk after the branch name. This is incredibly helpful for seeing at a glance what state you are in, without having to issue the commands &#8216;git branch&#8217; or &#8216;git status&#8217;. If you flit about between branches a lot, having the branch name at the command prompt can save you from a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>You can grab Henrik&#8217;s code <a href="http://gist.github.com/31631">here</a>, or use mine below. I just foraged around among the forks and the comments on <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/13/show-your-git-branch-name-in-your-prompt/">this related post</a> to get a version combining the best bits of them all, then I substituted in my existing command prompt. Enjoy!</p>

    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/tracks-gets-its-own-domain-name</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;and a new home! I have now completed the migration to the new Shared Accelerator at <a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent.com</a>, and in the process, gave Tracks its own domain name: getontracks.org. You may find that the new server feels a bit more snappy than the old one, and it should be more stable and reliable. The migration process was fairly complex, and it&#8217;s possible that some links may be broken, so do please email me if you find anything amiss. I&#8217;ve redirected the old domain to the new one, so feed readers should pick up the redirection. If they do not, you might want to enter the new feed <span class="caps">URL</span> manually for the <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/tracks/rss_2.0/">RSS2 feed</a> or <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/tracks/atom/">Atom feed</a>.</p>
<p>I was hoping to replace our Trac bug tracker with a custom solution run with ExpressionEngine (which runs this site), but importing existing tickets proved too much for my pre-Christmas brain! Instead, I imported all the old tickets into an <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/tracks-tickets/tickets">Assembla space</a>. Assembla offers a number of rather cool features, and will be easier for me to administer. You can find out how to use the site to submit tickets <a href="http://getontracks.org/development/">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GitHub provides a handy shortcut for creating a <a href="http://pledgie.org/">Pledgie</a> campaign, and shows the button on the repository page. We were previously accepting donations using a Paypal button, which meant I then had to do some mental arithmetic and manually update the MacBook-O-Meter to show the additional donations. Pledgie is much easier to use, so I&#8217;ve now embedded the Pledgie button on the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/tracks/contribute">Contribute</a> page, and also in the sidebar of the site. Click the button if you feel like making a donation! Pledgie donations can be anonymous or you can display your name proudly in the donors list, and you can use PayPal or a credit card for payment.</p>

    <updated>2008-06-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/tracks-moves-to-github</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m happy to say that Tracks has now moved to GitHub. The subversion repository is still available as a read-only repository, but all new development will happen via <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> at  <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks/tree">GitHub</a>. The main reason for this move is to make it much easier for people to contribute to the project. Anyone can clone the repository and submit patches, but to make life even easier, you can sign up for a free account at GitHub and then fork Tracks. GitHub provides a &#8216;pull request&#8217; button, so when you&#8217;ve added something cool or fixed a bug, hit the button and we&#8217;ll pull in your changes. Git makes merging <strong>much</strong> easier than Subversion, even if the codebase has moved on a bit since you created the patch.</p>
<p>The latest stable version of Tracks can still be downloaded as a .zip file (see the download link in the sidebar). If you don&#8217;t want to install Git, but you are feeling adventurous and want to get the very latest development version, you can use the &#8216;Download&#8217; button on the GitHub page to get a tarball of the project.</p>
<p>To clone Tracks, change to a directory in which you want to store Tracks (e.g. ~/Sites):</p>
<pre>
<code>
git clone git://github.com/bsag/tracks.git
cd tracks
</code>
</pre>
<p>If (when!) you produce a cool new feature or fix a bug, create a patch. If you develop in a branch called &#8216;experiment&#8217;:</p>
<pre>
<code>
git diff master..experiment &gt; my_feature.patch 
</code>
</pre>
<p>Then attach my_feature.patch to a ticket.</p>
<p>Or you can sign up for a free account on github and fork Tracks using the convenient button. You can then use the button to issue a pull request for your changes to be pulled into the main repository.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just uploaded an introductory screencast to the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/screenshots/index">screenshots</a> page. In it, I introduce the basics of starting with a new, blank installation of Tracks, adjusting the preferences, adding contexts, projects and actions, and editing actions. In due course, I&#8217;ll add more screencasts on specific aspects, like using tags, the tickler, and the statistics page.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first screencast I&#8217;ve done with a voiceover, so please forgive the stumbling, mumbling parts. Watching the screencast, you might marvel at the fact that I lecture for a living. The thing is, I&#8217;m used to a live audience (except at 9am Monday lectures, where the audience is mostly asleep), and talking to myself felt distinctly odd. I also seemed to be channelling Bill Lumbergh from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a>, with my &#8220;let&#8217;s go ahead and&#8230;&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know why, because I almost never say that in real life. Anyway, enjoy, and try not to laugh too hard.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Manuel Morales from <a href="http://bitnami.org/">BitNami</a> emailed to tell me about the <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks">Tracks Stack</a> they have developed. These are easy to install, multi-platform packages for installing various Open Source applications. You download a package which installs as a stand-alone stack of all of the components required to run the application. What this means is that if you want to run Tracks on Windows XP, Linux or Mac OS X, but you don&#8217;t really know where to start with installing Ruby, Rails and MySQL, you can just download the stack. It installs everything you need and even configures the application and the database for you. The Tracks Stack installs the brand spanking new Tracks version 1.5rc1.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re interested by Tracks but have been daunted by the installation procedure, give a <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks">Tracks Stack</a> a whirl!</p>

    <updated>2007-03-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/a-really-easy-installation-for-macos-x-users</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with Locomotive recently, and I&#8217;m really impressed how easy the whole process is now. I&#8217;ve altered the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/files/tracks-1.043.zip">zip package</a> of Tracks 1.043 to make it as easy as possible for MacOS X users. I&#8217;ve pre-configured the package to use the SQLite3 database, which is included in the package, and also set up the logs and environment.rb file so that all you need to do is download Locomotive, point it at your Tracks folder and go! The full instructions are in the tracks-1.043 folder in <code>installation.html</code>.</p>
<p>As a side effect, the process of installation should be a little easier for Windows and Linux users too, because you no longer need to do the tedious copying of the *.tmpl files and folders. I&#8217;ve also included a security patch (details <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/changeset/475">here</a>). If you&#8217;re using Tracks on a public server, I would install the new version, but if it&#8217;s on your own machine with no public access, you should be fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to radically overhaul both the installation method and instructions for the next release, because I know that people get put off by the installation process.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2007-03-25:</strong> A few users bumped into a problem with using newer versions of the Locomotive bundles (see explanation <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/forums/viewreply/413/">here</a>), so I&#8217;ve updated the tracks-1.043.zip package to fix the problem, and updated the installation.html to explain the importance of using the &#8216;Standard Rails March 2007&#8217; bundle.</p>

    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/articles/comments/linking-actions-and-yojimbo-items</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If, like me, you have the snippet manager <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml">Yojimbo</a>, you might be interested in a way to link actions to Yojimbo items. I often use this if I want to make extensive notes on an action, or if I want to update those notes frequently. It&#8217;s also handy if you want to keep login details close at hand for an action, but you don&#8217;t want to store passwords in plain text in Tracks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy. In Yojimbo, select the item you want to link, then go to Edit &gt; Copy Item Link. Then switch to Tracks and click the edit button for the action you&#8217;re interested in. Paste the link you copied into the notes box, wrapped as a Textile link, like so (note that I&#8217;ve added spaces around the colon so that it renders properly on the page):</p>
<pre>
<code>
"Yojimbo item" : x-yojimbo-item://A8A40A39-blah-blah

<p>When you update the action and open the notes field, you&#8217;ll find a clickable link that will open your Yojimbo item. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that&#8217;s crying out for an Applescript or a Quicksilver script to automate it, but it&#8217;s easy enough to do manually.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed the new box at the top of the sidebar on the right. Joyent &mdash; the company that produces the Joyent Connector online team management software, TextDrive webhosting, Strongspace secure backup space and Bingo! online storage &mdash; is participating in an affiliate programme. It works like this: if you click the links to the right and subsequently sign up for any of the services, I will get 15% of the sale, which will go towards supporting Tracks development.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m usually very wary of advertising of any form, but in this case, I&#8217;m happy to do it. After all, I eat my own dog food! All of my sites are hosted by TextDrive, and I&#8217;ve been more than happy with the service. I also have a Strongspace account, which is incredibly useful.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking for hosting, online storage or backup or team management software, do give them a look, and perhaps we can all benefit!</p>
