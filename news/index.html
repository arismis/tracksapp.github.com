  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may know, we are in the process of moving the project and all the related web resources over to GitHub. As a first step, I have set up the <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp">Tracks project</a> as a GitHub Organisation, which makes it easier for people to administer and collaborate on the project. I have also moved the content of the entire wiki over to a GitHub wiki, <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki">here</a>. I&#8217;ve removed the old wiki to avoid confusion, and redirected the <span class="caps">URL</span> to the new wiki.</p>
<p>You can still contribute to the new wiki: if you have a GitHub account, you can edit and add pages. I hope you like the new wiki &#8211; I think it is a big improvement, and a lot more flexible.</p>

<p>I was informed by private email that a <span class="caps">XSS</span> vulnerability is present in 1.7.2. It turned out to also exist in the upcoming 2.0.</p>
<p>A new release of 1.7.3 is made available <a href="https://github.com/bsag/tracks/zipball/v1.7.3">here</a>. Users of 1.7x are strongly advised to upgrade to 1.7.3.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The nice people at <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/">JumpBox</a> have just released a <a href="http://jumpbox.com/app/tracks">JumpBox for Tracks 1.7</a>. JumpBoxes are pre-built, pre-configured virtual applications which run in a range of <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/supported-virtualization-software">Virtualization software applications</a>. You just download the JumpBox (free), then open the file with your Virtualization software. Once the JumpBox has booted, it will give you a <span class="caps">URL</span> which you can visit in a browser. The software will then guide you through setting up an account. If you&#8217;d like to try out the JumpBox without installing it, you can use the &#8220;Trial This JumpBox&#8221; button on the web site, which will let you play around with it to test it out. It&#8217;s great to have another method of using Tracks for those of you who don&#8217;t want to go to the trouble of installing Tracks and its dependencies on your computer, or installing Tracks on a web host. Try it out! You can download it directly <a href="http://download.jumpbox.com/download/tracks">here</a>. I&#8217;ll add links and instructions to the manual in due course.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;and a new home! I have now completed the migration to the new Shared Accelerator at <a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent.com</a>, and in the process, gave Tracks its own domain name: getontracks.org. You may find that the new server feels a bit more snappy than the old one, and it should be more stable and reliable. The migration process was fairly complex, and it&#8217;s possible that some links may be broken, so do please email me if you find anything amiss. I&#8217;ve redirected the old domain to the new one, so feed readers should pick up the redirection. If they do not, you might want to enter the new feed <span class="caps">URL</span> manually for the <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/tracks/rss_2.0/">RSS2 feed</a> or <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/tracks/atom/">Atom feed</a>.</p>
<p>I was hoping to replace our Trac bug tracker with a custom solution run with ExpressionEngine (which runs this site), but importing existing tickets proved too much for my pre-Christmas brain! Instead, I imported all the old tickets into an <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/tracks-tickets/tickets">Assembla space</a>. Assembla offers a number of rather cool features, and will be easier for me to administer. You can find out how to use the site to submit tickets <a href="http://getontracks.org/development/">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>GitHub provides a handy shortcut for creating a <a href="http://pledgie.org/">Pledgie</a> campaign, and shows the button on the repository page. We were previously accepting donations using a Paypal button, which meant I then had to do some mental arithmetic and manually update the MacBook-O-Meter to show the additional donations. Pledgie is much easier to use, so I&#8217;ve now embedded the Pledgie button on the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/tracks/contribute">Contribute</a> page, and also in the sidebar of the site. Click the button if you feel like making a donation! Pledgie donations can be anonymous or you can display your name proudly in the donors list, and you can use PayPal or a credit card for payment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m happy to say that Tracks has now moved to GitHub. The subversion repository is still available as a read-only repository, but all new development will happen via <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> at  <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks/tree">GitHub</a>. The main reason for this move is to make it much easier for people to contribute to the project. Anyone can clone the repository and submit patches, but to make life even easier, you can sign up for a free account at GitHub and then fork Tracks. GitHub provides a &#8216;pull request&#8217; button, so when you&#8217;ve added something cool or fixed a bug, hit the button and we&#8217;ll pull in your changes. Git makes merging <strong>much</strong> easier than Subversion, even if the codebase has moved on a bit since you created the patch.</p>
<p>The latest stable version of Tracks can still be downloaded as a .zip file (see the download link in the sidebar). If you don&#8217;t want to install Git, but you are feeling adventurous and want to get the very latest development version, you can use the &#8216;Download&#8217; button on the GitHub page to get a tarball of the project.</p>
<p>To clone Tracks, change to a directory in which you want to store Tracks (e.g. ~/Sites):</p>
<pre>
<code>
git clone git://github.com/bsag/tracks.git
cd tracks
</code>
</pre>
<p>If (when!) you produce a cool new feature or fix a bug, create a patch. If you develop in a branch called &#8216;experiment&#8217;:</p>
<pre>
<code>
git diff master..experiment &gt; my_feature.patch 
</code>
</pre>
<p>Then attach my_feature.patch to a ticket.</p>
<p>Or you can sign up for a free account on github and fork Tracks using the convenient button. You can then use the button to issue a pull request for your changes to be pulled into the main repository.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just uploaded an introductory screencast to the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/screenshots/index">screenshots</a> page. In it, I introduce the basics of starting with a new, blank installation of Tracks, adjusting the preferences, adding contexts, projects and actions, and editing actions. In due course, I&#8217;ll add more screencasts on specific aspects, like using tags, the tickler, and the statistics page.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first screencast I&#8217;ve done with a voiceover, so please forgive the stumbling, mumbling parts. Watching the screencast, you might marvel at the fact that I lecture for a living. The thing is, I&#8217;m used to a live audience (except at 9am Monday lectures, where the audience is mostly asleep), and talking to myself felt distinctly odd. I also seemed to be channelling Bill Lumbergh from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a>, with my &#8220;let&#8217;s go ahead and&#8230;&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know why, because I almost never say that in real life. Anyway, enjoy, and try not to laugh too hard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Manuel Morales from <a href="http://bitnami.org/">BitNami</a> emailed to tell me about the <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks">Tracks Stack</a> they have developed. These are easy to install, multi-platform packages for installing various Open Source applications. You download a package which installs as a stand-alone stack of all of the components required to run the application. What this means is that if you want to run Tracks on Windows XP, Linux or Mac OS X, but you don&#8217;t really know where to start with installing Ruby, Rails and MySQL, you can just download the stack. It installs everything you need and even configures the application and the database for you. The Tracks Stack installs the brand spanking new Tracks version 1.5rc1.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re interested by Tracks but have been daunted by the installation procedure, give a <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks">Tracks Stack</a> a whirl!</p>

I&#8217;ve pre-configured the package to use the SQLite3 database, which is included in the package, and also set up the logs and environment.rb file so that all you need to do is download Locomotive, point it at your Tracks folder and go! The full instructions are in the tracks-1.043 folder in <code>installation.html</code>.</p>
<p>As a side effect, the process of installation should be a little easier for Windows and Linux users too, because you no longer need to do the tedious copying of the *.tmpl files and folders. I&#8217;ve also included a security patch (details <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/changeset/475">here</a>). If you&#8217;re using Tracks on a public server, I would install the new version, but if it&#8217;s on your own machine with no public access, you should be fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to radically overhaul both the installation method and instructions for the next release, because I know that people get put off by the installation process.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2007-03-25:</strong> A few users bumped into a problem with using newer versions of the Locomotive bundles (see explanation <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/forums/viewreply/413/">here</a>), so I&#8217;ve updated the tracks-1.043.zip package to fix the problem, and updated the installation.html to explain the importance of using the &#8216;Standard Rails March 2007&#8217; bundle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You might have noticed the new box at the top of the sidebar on the right. Joyent &mdash; the company that produces the Joyent Connector online team management software, TextDrive webhosting, Strongspace secure backup space and Bingo! online storage &mdash; is participating in an affiliate programme. It works like this: if you click the links to the right and subsequently sign up for any of the services, I will get 15% of the sale, which will go towards supporting Tracks development.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m usually very wary of advertising of any form, but in this case, I&#8217;m happy to do it. After all, I eat my own dog food! All of my sites are hosted by TextDrive, and I&#8217;ve been more than happy with the service. I also have a Strongspace account, which is incredibly useful.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking for hosting, online storage or backup or team management software, do give them a look, and perhaps we can all benefit!</p>

As ever, thanks to all those who held the fort in my absence (and sorry I couldn&#8217;t let you know in advance &#8212; it was all a bit sudden), particularly Luke, who has carried on producing some great fixes while I&#8217;ve been away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://pmachine.com">ExpressionEngine Personal</a> also comes with a wiki module, which I&#8217;ve just set up. Previously, I was using a dokuwiki installation, which was difficult to maintain and had got rather outdated. Then I moved to the wiki included with <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/wiki">Trac</a>, which was much better, but because of the rather difficult way in which you have to manage users in Trac, it was a pain to set up users to allow them to edit the wiki, without leaving it open to all, which was just a spam magnet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/wiki/">The new wiki</a> is very nice and simple, and the great thing about it is that it shares user credentials with the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/forums/">forum</a>. So if you&#8217;re already registered with the forum, you can log in to the wiki and edit pages there too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just started porting some of the information over from the Trac wiki, but any help would be much appreciated as I&#8217;m chronically short of time at the moment. Eventually, I&#8217;ll reduce the information in the Trac wiki to the bare minimum for people wanting to check out the development trunk. It would be great if the new wiki could become a repository for the collected genius and experience of Tracks users, and could form a collaboratively written manual for it. The wiki uses <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> syntax, but you can also use plain &#8216;ole <span class="caps">HTML</span> markup. Have fun and get creative, and let&#8217;s see what we can come up with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had an unexpected and delightful email from Leslie Camacho, the VP of <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/">pMachine</a> (who produce <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/ee/">ExpressionEngine</a>, which runs this site). He offered to donate personal licences for ExpressionEngine itself (which allows me access to some very useful modules not available in the Core version), and for the <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/products/forum/">Discussion Forum module</a>. It was a very generous offer that I was very happy to take up. As a result, we now have a <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/forums/">new forum</a>! You can view the forum topics and postings without being logged in, but if you want to post, you&#8217;ll have to register to get a user account (just use the register link at the top of the forum page).</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to install a forum before because it seemed like a big hassle to have yet another kind of installation to manage. But the discussion module is wonderfully integrated into ExpressionEngine, and was easy to install once I sorted out a clash with my existing .htaccess rules (which wasn&#8217;t ExpressionEngine&#8217;s fault). Even better, user management is shared across the installation, so if you register, you can use the same login to comment on the project weblog, and if I install the wiki module, you can also use the same credentials there.</p>
<p>So have fun and chat away. I&#8217;m hoping that the forum will become a great resource for the community to share knowledge and ideas, which will supplement the existing mailing list.</p>
<p>Once again, a big thank you to Leslie at <a href="http://pmachine.com">pMachine</a> for the licences!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an Outlook-like experience, you&#8217;ll be disappointed. Tracks is not &#8220;___ for the Web&#8221;, it&#8217;s about organizing your next actions the <span class="caps">GTD</span> way. Yet, it doesn&#8217;t impose any strict set of rules, it guides you gently towards a better way to organize stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just updated the migrations files in both the tracks-1.041.zip package and in the tagged 1.041 release. Many (<em>many</em>) people had trouble with the migrations for various reasons, one of which was that there was a bit of raw <span class="caps">SQL</span> which would cause some databases to choke. Windows users also seemed to have trouble with it. Anyway, I&#8217;ve changed the migrations now so that they use Rails itself to generate the <span class="caps">SQL</span>, which means that it gets appropriately translated for the different databases. So &mdash; fingers crossed &mdash; it should work much better now!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been having trouble with your rake migrate, download again and give it a go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Somebody called Fipps added Tracks to <a href="http://www.listible.com/list/gtd-software">Listible</a> with other <span class="caps">GTD</span>&trade; software resources. The idea of Listible is that people submit resources, and people vote for their favourites, moving items up and down the list as an outcome of the voting process. It&#8217;s quite an interesting idea, and at one point, Tracks was sitting at number 3. As I write this, it&#8217;s at number 5, but in some very good company with applications like <a href="http://shared.snapgrid.com/gtd_tiddlywiki.html"><span class="caps">GTD</span> TiddlyWiki</a> and <a href="http://www.kinkless.com/">Kinkless <span class="caps">GTD</span></a>.</p>
<p>Listible gets a lot of traffic, and referrals from it pushed my stats up into a massive spike. Personally, I don&#8217;t worry much about stats, though I find it interesting to follow the trends. I&#8217;m much happier, for example, if fewer people are regular visitors than if I get huge numbers of temporary visitors. Still, if a even a few of those temporary visitors discover Tracks and enjoy using it, I&#8217;m pretty happy with that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mike Lamb kindly let me know that Tracks was featured in the <a href="http://www.cubicleescape.com/v3/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=242&amp;Itemid=37">Cubicle Escape Podcast</a>. They seemed to like Tracks, but have trouble with the installation, which I know many people do. I try to make installation as easy as possible, but Rails-based applications do unfortunately need quite a few dependencies to be installed first. As a side note, if you&#8217;re not an alpha level geek, it&#8217;s worth trying one of the one-click Rails environments. There&#8217;s <a href="http://locomotive.raaum.org/home/show/HomePage">Locomotive</a> for Mac OS X and <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">Instant Rails</a> for Windows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been hard at work for the past couple of weeks and have re-designed this site &#8212; as you can hopefully see! I used to use <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> for the site, which was very good, but I found it a bit tricky to maintain and extend. So after playing with a few CMSs, I decided to use the free <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/ee/">ExpressionEngine Core</a>. It&#8217;s really flexible, which has meant that I can easily maintain a more or less static front page with the features of Tracks, and then have dynamic pages for news, articles and so on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added the existing installation instructions to start off a manual, which I&#8217;ll be adding to over the coming months. Commenting now uses CAPTCHAs, which I agonised a bit about because of the lack of accessibility, but moderating all comments was becoming a real pain. If anyone has problems submitting a comment, please drop me a line and I&#8217;ll try to sort it out. Note that the <span class="caps">URL</span> for the feed has changed (the link is in the sidebar). If anyone knows how to redirect <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds, please let me know!</p>
<p>Until I&#8217;ve sorted out redirection, internal links might be broken. If you want to manually fix them to get to the article you want, just substitute the two digits in the <span class="caps">URL</span> with &#8216;comments&#8217; and &#8216;article&#8217; with &#8216;articles&#8217;.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tracks 1.04 is ready for <a href="http://rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/31/tracks-104">download</a>. I know that it&#8217;s been a long time coming, but I hope it&#8217;s worth it. Check the changelog in the distribution for details, but the major new features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Proper multi-user abilities, added mainly by Nicholas Lee. User preferences are now stored in the database rather than the settings.yml file, so each user can have their own preferences.</li>
	<li>Much improved <span class="caps">AJAX</span> features, so that adding, editing, deleting and checking off next action is very speedy because you don&#8217;t have to wait for the page to refresh &#8212; (nearly) instant gratification!</li>
	<li>Validation errors are much more gracefully handled.</li>
	<li>Many more options for the <span class="caps">RSS</span> and text feeds, added by Luke Melia. These are accessed via the feed image link in the main navigation.</li>
	<li>You can add notes to projects to hold associated information.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot more changes which are less obvious but will provide a much cleaner and more stable base for future changes. I&#8217;ve got many more features planned, but I need a short break before I start on Tracks 1.05! Have fun, and as usual, let me know what you think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to take this opportunity to thank all of those who have contributed patches, tested things, suggested features or reported bugs: you&#8217;ve all made Tracks a lot better than it would have been without your input.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1/3/2006</strong>: I&#8217;ve fixed the bugs that people reported with 1.04 and also updated the installation document to make the process a bit clearer and fix a couple of errors. The tags version is updated, and I&#8217;ve also uploaded a new zipped version too, available at the same url as the old one.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><del>Apologies for the errors on the <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/">development site</a>. There&#8217;s a technical problem with Trac (which runs the ticket and wiki system) at the moment, and it&#8217;s in the process of being fixed.</del> It&#8217;s fixed now.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to say that &mdash; contrary to the apparent lack of activity on this site &mdash; Tracks is alive and kicking, and I and the other contributors have been hard at work improving and adding new features to Tracks. It&#8217;s been quite a long time since the last stable update, in part because I wanted Rails to stabilise feature-wise before I put out another release. Rails reached 1.0 a little while ago, and has some great new features that make my life a lot easier, so I&#8217;m hoping that there will be a new release of Tracks out very soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reluctant to put a fixed time on it because I can only work on it in my so-called spare time, so progress is inversely determined by how busy my life and work is. However, I can say that I&#8217;m just going to try to add one more feature, make life as easy as possible for those installing and those upgrading from the existing version, and then I&#8217;ll just be squashing bugs before Tracks 1.04 is out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m off on a work trip to Brazil shortly, and will return in the last week of September. I&#8217;m almost certainly not going to be able to get a network connection, so things are likely to be a bit quiet around here for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Do continue to post ideas and bug fixes to <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/">Trac</a>, and I&#8217;ll sort through them when I get back. Nic has agreed (even though he&#8217;s really busy at the moment too) to check through them intermittently and try to deal with anything urgent.</p>
<p>However, Tracks development won&#8217;t stop: I&#8217;m taking a Linux-based laptop on which I can hack away during those long tropical nights, and I&#8217;m hoping to squash a few bug and perhaps add a new feature or two while I&#8217;m away. That&#8217;s the plan, anyway.</p>
<p>See you when I return!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve got some good news; the cool people at <a href="http://textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a> have set up a <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> (yes, I know those names are going to get confusing) installation for me <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/wiki">here</a>. Trac is an Open Source project to help developers to share their work with others and accept contributions of bug reports, feature requests or patches.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really nice system in which you can view already submitted tickets, submit your own tickets and browse the source files in development, which are versioned using Subversion. There&#8217;s also a wiki, in which I&#8217;ve started to write a guide to installing Tracks and all the dependencies, along with a few other snippets. Eventually, I&#8217;ll try to extract everything that&#8217;s still relevant from the old Dokuwiki <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/wiki/">install</a> and include it. Until the dust has settled, only I can edit the Trac wiki, but I hope to open editing up to everyone in due course.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/newticket">create tickets</a> for any bugs you&#8217;ve found, features you&#8217;d like to suggest and so on. Please add as much detail as possible, particularly with bug reports; &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; isn&#8217;t very helpful. You can submit anonymously if you like, but if you don&#8217;t mind providing it, an email address would be very helpful if I need to get in touch with you to find out more detail on your report. Also, please try to scan the previous tickets to see if your bug/feature has been suggested before submitting a duplicate request.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this. I&#8217;ve had three very helpful patches recently from (in no particular order) Lolindrath, Jim Ray and Nicholas Lee, so contributions to the project are really starting to take off. Using Trac will make it much easier for people to make a contribution, even if it is a contribution of ideas rather than code, and it will be much easier for me to keep track of (sorry) than the old wiki.</p>
<p>One word of caution; while you can check out a copy of the version that I&#8217;m currently developing from the trunk using <code>svn</code>, please be aware that it is a very bleeding edge version. I frequently break stuff in there while fixing other things, and it&#8217;s not suitable for actual use. Anyway, if you&#8217;re curious or want to generate a patch to add a new feature against the latest version, the <span class="caps">URL</span> is:</p>
<pre>
<code>
svn co --username=guest http://www.rousette.org.uk/svn/tracks-repos/trunk/tracks
</code>
</pre>
<p>The username is &#8216;guest&#8217;. Once you&#8217;ve checked out the latest trunk, added your fix, <strong>tested it</strong> and found that it works, just issue the following command in the root of the tracks directory:</p>
<pre>
<code>
svn diff &gt; /pathto/your_name_patch_description.patch
</code>
</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve submitted a ticket describing what your patch does, you should be able to view the ticket and use the &#8216;Attach file&#8217; button to attach your *.patch file (I&#8217;m not sure why that&#8217;s not possible when you create the ticket).</p>
<p>Go mad with it!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just posted Tracks 1.02a <a href="http://rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/18/tracks-102a">here</a>. I was hoping to add a few more features before 1.02a, but there&#8217;s still quite a lot of new stuff, and I wanted people to be able to take advantage of Rails 0.10.0. So this version of Rails is a <strong>requirement</strong> for Tracks 1.02a, and it will hopefully solve the problems people had when trying to downgrade to a compatible Rails version with Tracks 1.01.</p>
<p>Have fun, and as usual, let me know if I&#8217;ve broken anything. In case you&#8217;re wondering (and I can tell that you are&#8230;) the &#8216;a&#8217; suffix is due to the fact that I messed up the first tagged version in svn, and couldn&#8217;t figure out how to delete a tag <img src="http://www.getontracks.org/images/smileys/wink.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="wink" style="border:0;" />.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve managed to get Subversion access set up for Tracks. At the moment, you can only checkout from the &#8216;tags&#8217; directory using the username &#8216;guest&#8217; and password &#8216;guest&#8217;. You can&#8217;t check your changes back in&#8212;if you&#8217;d like to be able to contribute to the project, please let me know (tell me your preferred username and pasword), and I&#8217;ll add access for you. My proposal is that the &#8216;trunk&#8217; directory is just for me to break things in <img src="http://www.getontracks.org/images/smileys/wink.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="wink" style="border:0;" />, while the &#8216;tags&#8217; directory is for people to checkout stable releases. The &#8216;branches&#8217; directory will be for people to contribute their fixes and code additions.</p>
<p>If you want to checkout the stable 1.01 release of Tracks (see <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/">Download</a> page for details of what&#8217;s in the new release), you can enter the following in a terminal (assuming that you have a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion client</a> on your machine):</p>
<pre>
<code>
cd ~/Sites
svn co --username=guest http://www.rousette.org.uk/svn/tracks-repos/tags/tracks-1.01/tracks
</code>
</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll get the following prompt, at which you should enter the password &#8216;guest&#8217; (without quotes):</p>
<pre>
<code>
Authentication realm: &lt;http://www.rousette.org.uk:80&gt; rousette.org.uk
Password for 'guest':
</code>
</pre>
<p>Subversion will then copy the directory &#8216;tracks&#8217; into ~/Sites. Make sure that you don&#8217;t over-write any version you want to keep! I&#8217;ve made a few changes to the config/* files and the logs directory to ease updating with Subversion, so please read tracks/README_FIRST/ and tracks/doc/<span class="caps">README</span>.txt carefully before you start using it.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just uploaded the next major release of my app, which is now called &#8216;Tracks&#8217; (see the comments <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/12/23/a-new-site-for-the-gtd-application/">here</a> for the brainstorming on the name). Full details are <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/8/version-10">here</a>.</p>
<p>Main new features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated to run on Rails 0.9.x</li>
	<li>You can now add next actions to a particular Project on the Project page. This makes it easy to add a load of next actions while you&#8217;re thinking about a particular project.</li>
	<li>A rudimentary login system, which password protects all the main files.</li>
	<li>Feeds; there&#8217;s a fairly basic <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed, and a plain text feed so that you can use <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">GeekTool&#8217;s</a> magic to display all your next actions on the desktop (thanks to <a href="http://www.braino.org/blog/archives/001512.php">Daniel Von Fange</a> for the idea).</li>
	<li>User-settable date format. I was previously being rather dictatorial <strong>and</strong> inconsistent by forcing <span class="caps">YYYY</span>-MM-DD format to enter the dates, and displaying it as DD-MM-<span class="caps">YYYY</span> format. Now you can choose your own format, and this is used for both entry and display.</li>
	<li>Uses <a href="http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/">RedCloth 3.0</a> for the markup in the notes field. This gives you the best of both worlds by allowing both Textile and Markdown markup.</li>
	<li>Various bits of tidying up, bug fixes and improvements (and probably many more bugs added!)</li>
</ul></div>
