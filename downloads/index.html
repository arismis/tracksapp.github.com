<p>A message from Reinier Balt, who has worked incredibly hard on this release. Congratulations to him and to all the other contributors!</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After way too long time (1.7 was released on 28 feb 2009!) we are finally releasing Tracks 2.0. I&#8217;m hoping to shorten the release cycle in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>You can download this new stable version of Tracks <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Important for upgrade is that the requirements for running Tracks have changed (ruby 1.8.7 / rubgems ~1.5.0). Also be aware when upgrading from a recent development version or RC version to delete the caches stylesheets and javascripts from your install. The updated installation manual can be found on github and on the Tracks website, also containing the details of the changed requirements and deleting the cached files from your previous install.</p>
<p>Please note that xuinkrbin has started a <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Users-Manual">user manual</a> on the wiki. Anyone like to help out and write some stuff about setting up and using Tracks? A user manual if often asked for.</p>
<p>A lot of effort went into Tracks 2.0 and we have seen quite a few new (and old :-) ) contributors helping out with patches and github pull requests. Thanks to you all!</p>
<p>Now, onto the details of this release.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<p>1. Redesign of menus and introduction of a context menu per todo<br />
2. You can now set the default tags for a project which are added automatically to a new action in that project if no tags are supplied<br />
3. Tracks now includes support of dependencies. Making an action dependent on another action will hide it until the dependency is completed<br />
4. you can now drag an action from one context to another<br />
5. Support for entering multiple actions in one form<br />
6. You can now promote an action to a project<br />
7. It is easier to view notes on the mobile interface and other interface fixes<br />
8. The project description supports markup<br />
9. support for Mail.app (message://) and OneNote (onenote://) links in notes<br />
10.The email receiver is now able to receive email from several email adresses.  In site.yml this could be set to the previous behavior (receive from one address per user)<br />
11.You can enable open signup (like in tracks.tra.in) <br />
12.Cleanup of context page<br />
13.Support for <span class="caps">CAS</span> for login<br />
14.Support for adding Tracks as a GMail Widget with instructions on the Integrations page<br />
15.Tracks now support internationalization. First translations are German and Dutch. See http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Translating-Tracks it you like to help translating Tracks to other languages. Please report any errors in translations to our bug tracker at Assembla!</p>
<p>Under the hood</p>
<p>1. All js is migrated to jQuery and most ui-widgets are migrated to jQuery-UI<br />
2. Cucumber is added for integration testing. The RSpec stories are migrated to cucumber, so are most selenium scripts<br />
3. Upgraded to rails 2.3.11 and upgraded most gems/plugins<br />
3. Bugfixes (lots of them)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Version: 1.7</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/tree/1.7_branch">Git <span class="caps">URL</span></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Tracks 1.7 has been released.</p>
<p>You can download this new stable version of Tracks at <a href="http://bsag.bingodisk.com/public/files/tracks-current.zip">here</a> and an updated manual can be found on <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks_manual/tree/master">github</a> and on the <a href="http://getontracks.org/doc/index.html">Tracks website</a></p>
<p>What is new in 1.7:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The included Rails version is updated to 2.2.2</li>
	<li>Tracks now supports recurring/repeating todos</li>
	<li>Cleanup of feed page and add feed for starred actions</li>
	<li>New interface to import an email / sms messages into Tracks (needs an email server on the same server as Tracks)</li>
	<li>New buttons to quickly defer an action 1 or 7 days</li>
	<li>Calendar view to review upcoming due actions, includes iCal feed to use in your calendar app (tested with Google Calendar, Evolution, Outlook 2007)</li>

	<li>We now allow users again to stay logged in on two devices at the same time</li>
	<li>Move site specific configuration out of environment.rb into site.yml for easier updating</li>

Just fill in your settings from your old environment.rb in the new site.yml. If you have made any other customizations to environment.rb in the past, you can put them in your own configuration file (for example, in my-config.rb) in config/initializers. Please let us know if you think they should be in site.yml.tmpl.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WARNING</span>: if you update to 1.7 using git, your environment.rb will be overwritten. SO <span class="caps">PLEASE</span> <span class="caps">MAKE</span> <span class="caps">BACKUPS</span></p>

Thank you all for helping Tracks getting better every release. As ever particular thanks to Luke (for updating Tracks to 2.2.2) and to Eric Allen for lots of work on a many fronts, including the site.yml improvements!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Version: 1.7RC2</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/tree/1.7_branch">Git <span class="caps">URL</span></a></p>
<p>Reinier Balt has already announced the release of Tracks 1.7RC2, but I&#8217;ve finally (and belatedly!) found time to upload the zipped file and update the manual.</p>
<p>Reinier&#8217;s release notes:</p>
<p>We have many improvements based on the feedback on RC1. We felt we should first do a RC2 to make sure all improvements did not introduce new regressions. Please help out to test this second pre-release to find any bugs before we release 1.7 in a few weeks</p>
<p>What was new in RC1:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The included Rails version is updated to 2.2.2</li>
	<li>Tracks now supports recurring/repeating todos</li>
	<li>Cleanup of feed page and add feed for starred actions</li>
	<li>Initial importer of yaml files (still very <span class="caps">EXPERIMENTAL</span>; please send feedback on whether to include this; make backups while testing it)</li>
	<li>New interface to import an email / sms messages into Tracks (needs an email server on the same server as Tracks)</li>
	<li>New buttons to quickly defer an action 1 or 7 days</li>
	<li>Calendar view to review upcoming due actions, includes iCal feed to use in your calendar app (tested with Google Calendar, Evolution, Outlook 2007)</li>
	<li>You can now sort projects on number of active todos</li>
	<li>Support for OpenSearch. This means you can add a Tracks as a search provider in your webbrowser (tested on FF3 and IE7)</li>
	<li>Bugfixes, including fixing OpenID</li>
</ul>
<p>New in RC2:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We now allow users again to stay logged in on two devices at the same time</li>
	<li>Move site specific configuration out of environment.rb into site.yml for easier updating</li>
	<li>Bugfixes, including the upgrade of has_many_polymorphs which will fix the problem of not being able to migrate from 1.6 because of non-existing recurring_todos table.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are changes to the database (even between RC1 and RC2), and changes to the way you configure Tracks, so please migrate your database and redo your Tracks configuration.</p>
<p>In Tracks 1.7RC2 the site specific configuration is moved from environment.rb into the new site.yml. This makes updating environment.rb much easier without you needing to set your site specific settings after each update. After you install/upgrade Tracks 1.7RC2 there will be no environment.rb.tmpl anymore. You will find an environment.rb which you can leave untouched.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Version: Tracks 1.6</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Tracks 1.6 has been released.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The included Rails version is updated to 2.0.2</li>
	<li>You can now search the contents of todos, projects and notes (thanks, Jeffrey Gipson!)</li>
	<li>Improvements to the mobile view, including a few iPhone specific improvements for those of you lucky enough to have an iPhone</li>
	<li>A few bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>An important caveat is that OpenID support is broken in 1.6. The fix is a bit complicated because of changes to the ruby-openid gem, so we wanted to get 1.6 out before fixing it. If you depend on OpenID support, we&#8217;d advise waiting until the next release.</p>
<p>There are no changes to the database, but quite a few changes to config/environment.rb.tmpl, so please copy the template file and merge your personalisations with it.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Luke, Reinier and Jeffrey for their hard work on this release!</p></div>

	<li>Rake task to set password. Usage: rake tracks:password <span class="caps">USER</span>=username</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also some bug fixes since 1.5rc1:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can now use tags containing dots</li>
	<li>Badge count on tag page works properly</li>
	<li>Auto-complete drop down menu works properly</li>
	<li>New todos that belong to hidden or completed projects are not added to the home page or context page</li>
	<li>Now report revision number from TRACKS_ROOT instead of the current directory. To use this fix if you&#8217;re using 1.5 or trunk, you need to recreate your environment.rb from the template</li>
	<li>When viewing a context, actions without projects are now shown</li>
	<li>Various improvements to rendering time on home page when you have a lot of todos</li>
	<li>Edit form now uses the correct default context after you have changed it</li>
	<li>Clears completed_at field when you mark a completed task as incomplete again</li>
	<li>New tests for new features and bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, many thanks are due to everyone who has helped on this release, particularly Reinier Balt.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2008-04-01</strong>: Updated the zip package so that Tracks displays the correct version number (1.5).</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NEW</span>! All-in-one installation!</strong></p>
<p>If you want an easy, automated install which includes everything you need, download the <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks">BitNami Tracks Stack</a>. There are versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (<span class="caps">PPC</span> and Intel). It includes Tracks 1.5, and now sets up an admin account for you as part of the installation process.</p></div>
